    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
    <p>The Heading tags display the various levels you can put on your webpage.
        H1 is reserved for the content that is the most important. Whereas, h6 is the least important.
    </p>
  <p> Paragraph tags  are used to show blocks of text.This is an opeing</p>
  <h2>Lists</h2>
  <p>There are two methods of displaying a list in html. first, you have the unordered list. the is a UL tag.
    Next, you have the ordered list. This is displayed using the ol tag. Unordered lists are for things that have
    no real order, maybe a shopping list. Whereas, the ordered list has an order. this could be a recipe.
    Items are displayed in the list with an LI.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>bread</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>tomatoes</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li>preheat oven</li>
    <li>place brownies in oven</li>
    <li>remove when timer dings</li>
    <li>enjoy</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Anchors and Links</h2>
  <p>To go from place to place, or more specifically, surf the web a web page must have an anchor tag and an href.
    The combination of those two will enable the webdeveloper to build the web. For example,
    the following link: <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">www.google.com</a> will take you to google. And this link : <a href="#top-of-page">TOP OF PAGE</a> will take you to the top of the page.
  </p>
 <h2>Text Emphasis</h2>
 <p>Sometimes, a developer wants to emphazise parts of the page. That would be for accessibility purposes. For example, to stress a particular word,
    like, "she screamed get out of the water <em>now!!!!</em>"", the devloper would wrap the text in an em tag. the em tag would give the
text an italized formatting and it would tell screen readers, for example, to stress that word.
or maybe a phrase has strong importance. for example, "With our dog, no matter how much he begs, <strong>we never feed him after 10pm</strong>". </p>
<h2>Organizing the Page with `div` and `span`</h2>
<p>The div, span, and br elements are used to group similar items on a page together.</p>
<p> The `div` element is a block element, so each `div` will stack on top of the others.</p>
<div>1st Div</div>
<div>2nd Div</div>
<div>3rd Div</div>
<p>The `span` element is an inline element. Each span will stay on the line its supposed to be on.</p>
<span>1st Span</span>
<span>2nd Span</span>
<span>3rd Span</span>

<p>When you need to have a line breaking up your non paragraph text, you use the `br` tag</p>
<h2>A Sample BR</h2>
<p>This is line one. <br>
This is line two. <br>
This is line three.<br></p>
